            <h3>🔒 The Short Version</h3>
            <p>Your receipts stay on your device. We don't collect, store, or sell your personal data. FieldReceipt is designed with privacy as a priority.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>FieldReceipt ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All receipt data, including images and extracted text, is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. Your receipts are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party cloud storage.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Device Identifier:</strong> We generate a random installation ID when you first open the app. This ID is used solely for rate limiting (enforcing the 100 scans/day limit) and preventing abuse. It cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

        <p><strong>Usage Counts:</strong> We track the number of scans you perform each day to enforce rate limits. This count is associated only with your anonymous installation ID and is reset daily.</p>

        <p><strong>We do NOT collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email, or contact information</li>
            <li>Receipt images or content</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Contacts or calendar data</li>
            <li>Browsing history</li>
            <li>Any data from other apps</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>AI Processing</h2>
        <p>When you scan a receipt, the extracted text is sent to our secure API for AI processing to identify merchant names, dates, amounts, and other details. This text is processed in real-time and is not stored on our servers after processing is complete.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> For AI-powered receipt text parsing. Text is processed according to <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI's privacy policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple App Attest:</strong> For device verification to prevent abuse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>All communication between the app and our API is encrypted using HTTPS. Your device is verified using Apple's App Attest service to ensure requests come from legitimate iOS devices.</p>

        <h2>Data Export</h2>
        <p>You can export all your receipt data as a CSV file at any time from within the app. This file is generated locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all your data at any time using the "Clear All Data" option in Settings. This permanently removes all receipts from your device. Since we don't store your receipt data on our servers, there's nothing to delete on our end.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>FieldReceipt is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
